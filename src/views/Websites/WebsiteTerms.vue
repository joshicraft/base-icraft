            Terms of Service
        </h1>
        <p>
            At ICRAFT we work hard to keep our clients happy and make sure they are getting what they want. All we ask
            in
            return is that our valued clients are reasonable in what they request and keep in mind our services and
            products
            are intentionally a lot cheaper than other providers because we cater to the budget-conscious businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re not sure about anything, please feel free to clarify with us first. We are happy to answer any
            questions you might have.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an aside well done for reading our terms and conditions, for some the fine print is just a waste of space
            but
            here at ICRAFT we encourage our clients to check their options, shop around, get quotes and educate
            themselves
            to protect against being swindled – unfortunately there are unsavoury operations out there (stick with the
            savoury kind). Now that we’ve got you thinking about sausage rolls, read on…
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Payment
        </h2>
        <p>
            In most cases, projects are divided into two payments – the initial deposit and the remaining balance due
            once
            the project has been completed. In some cases, such as extended projects, we may require progress payments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Payments can be made by internet banking or online. Click here to pay now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Non-payment of an invoice in full may result in forfeiting the website and related services. We also reserve
            the
            right to charge late payment fees and the account may be turned over to our debt collection agency.
            Non-payment
            for our hosting service may result in the removal of the website files from our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any hour credits owing as part of a registered Website Maintenance Package will be deducted from your
            invoice
            automatically before calculating any labour charges.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Project Delay
        </h2>
        <p>
            If your situation changes and you need to put your project on hold, we will lock in your quoted price for a
            period of 30 days from your estimated start date. After 30 days, it may be necessary to reassess your
            project if
            rates have changed. If you decide not to proceed, all deposits are forfeited. Any graphics, layouts or
            mock-ups
            will remain the property of ICRAFT and may be resold or redistributed as necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Projects that are deemed ‘abandoned’ (e.g. no contact is received within a period of 30 days) will be
            canceled
            and any monies paid forfeited.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Refunds
        </h2>
        <p>
            All payments are non-refundable upon receipt. In exceptional cases we may waive this.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Revisions
        </h2>
        <p>
            Before embarking on designing a website we attempt to get indications from the client about the style of
            website
            they are looking for. This may include links to websites they like.
        </p>
        <p>
            We cannot guarantee the final website may not always be identical to what the client had in mind and some
            concessions need to be made, however we can continue working on the style as chargeable time.
        </p>
        <p>
            When building a website you are free to request changes and we are happy to comply on the following
            conditions:
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiple minor revisions: You are welcome to make as many minor change requests during the design phase
            (within
            reason). Minor revisions are things such as changing a font, heading, or colour.
        </p>
        <p>
            Major revisions: Major revisions are changes that require a significant amount of time to complete and may
            include such things as requesting a different layout, background or theme design than the one initially
            presented to you. Major revisions are chargeable time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future changes: Once the site has been completed, future changes (whether minor or major) are chargeable
            time.
            Contact us for a quote.
        </p>
        <p>
            Third-party designer: We are happy to work with any 3rd-party designer you have contracted to design
            elements of
            your website however work done to a designer’s specifications is chargeable time. Please advise if you have
            specific budget constraints or require up-to-date billing details during the course of the project.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Communication
        </h2>
        <p>
            Communication about your website is to be primarily conducted by email, ff the client if close enough
            communication can be done in person at a pre-arranged location. Email provides both parties with a clear
            record
            of what has been discussed. If you need to talk to us, we do offer phone contact. We may not be available to
            take your call if we are currently with another client; another reason we recommend email.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also arrange Video or Audio calls over Skype or Google Meets at a time suitable for both parties.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Site Visits
        </h2>
        <p>
            We can make certain site visits (including planning meetings prior to contracting our services). If the
            location
            is more than 20 minutes from ICRAFT's location, ICRAFT will charge fee depending on time spent in transit,
            including travel costs. Contact us if you require a site visit and we will advise you of the charges and
            arrange
            a suitable time.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Domain Registration
        </h2>
        <p>
            In some cases we may register a domain on behalf of a client. While we may be listed as the owner (with the
            registrar) we acknowledge that true ownership rests with the client who has paid for the domain. If a client
            wants their details to be listed instead we are happy to effect this change (this may incur additional
            costs).
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Domain Renewals
        </h2>
        <p>
            In cases where we manage the renewal of domains, we will provide you with an email reminder in the month
            that it
            is due, using the email address supplied. We are not responsible for domain names that are lost due to these
            reminders being ignored, or any fees involved in the redemption process if this is requested. We require
            payment
            at least seven working days prior to renewing the domain.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Copyrights and Trademarks
        </h2>
        <p>
            Obtaining copyrights and permission for any photos or design elements provided by the client are the
            responsibility of the client. We are in no way liable or responsible for those graphics or photos.
        </p>
        <p>
            When providing artwork, graphics, or photos for use on your site, we require that you have license to use
            it.
            This means that it must be a royalty-free stock image or custom designed artwork where the original
            illustrator,
            photographer or artist has given you permission to use their work on your site. We do not take any
            responsibility for artwork used on your website that becomes the subject of a ‘take down’ notice (due to
            copyright infringement) but will assist you with removing it.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">

            Authorisation
        </h2>
        <p>
            As the client, you are authorising us to install any scripts, software or programs relevant to the web
            design
            project and to access your account via either your hosting service panel or external FTP. You shall
            agree to
            provide us with the login information and passwords necessary to access your website.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Credits & Usage
        </h2>
        <p>
            All graphics, illustrations, and layouts are intended to be kept whole as given to you. Work done by us
            may
            not
            be used by anyone else but the specified client on the domain for which it was originally designed. All
            preliminary designs to include graphics, layouts, etc., which are not selected by the client remain the
            full
            property of us and may be used in future projects for other clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            We retain all rights to display artwork in portfolios and advertising materials. Email testimonials from
            clients
            may be posted on our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            All website and blog designs require a text link or a graphic link back to ICRAFT unless other
            arrangements
            have
            been made. The link will remain in place until such time as that website design is no longer published
            on
            the
            internet.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Project Ownership
        </h2>
        <p>
            Ownership of final artwork designed by us will be transferred to the client upon final payment, unless
            otherwise
            specified by us. This does not include code or software. Copyright on all software and code remains the
            property
            of ICRAFT or its otherwise respective owner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Domains registered on behalf of clients are the property of the respective client. Transfers or change
            of
            details are available on request with any associated costs billed to the client.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-2">
            Cross-Browser Compatibility
        </h2>

        <p>
            Our designs meet the standards that comply with the latest browser versions and we are not responsible
            for
            inconsistencies that may appear when older browser versions are used.

            or plug-in.
        </p>

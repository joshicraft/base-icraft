        In the course of our business, we work with many different clients and become privy to commercially-sensitive information. Client confidentiality is of strict importance to us and we wish to assure all clients, past and present, that information is used only in the course of doing business with you.

        Any personal information is held in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993.

        ICRAFT does not sell, rent or otherwise make available any personal information to third parties. Only when this information is required by law or in the course of doing business and the information is needed to complete work requested.

        You may request access to personal information held by ICRAFT to both view or update your details.

        While every effort is made to keep client information secure and deny unauthorised access, ICRAFT cannot be held liable for events beyond its control or for MP restaurant receipts or hotel expenses that are leaked into the public domain. If that happens, Mr Jones or Mr Carter, you’re on your own.
